Contributor-types load profile
---------------------------------
* Normal load for classification-types api is between 0 - 200 concurrent users
* As we continue to increase number of concurrent users to 700, API times out and sometimes database connection doesnâ€™t close so henceforth no response is returned for any HTTP request. Database kind of just locks itself or freezes.
