Contributor-types load profile
---------------------------------
* The average load for contributor-types API is between 0 - 200 concurrent users
* As we continue to increase the number of concurrent users to 700, API times out and sometimes database connection doesnâ€™t close, so henceforth no response is returned for any HTTP request. Database kind of locks itself or freezes.
