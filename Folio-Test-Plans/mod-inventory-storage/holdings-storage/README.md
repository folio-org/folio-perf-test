Holdings-storage load profile
---------------------------------
* Normal load for classification-types API is between 0 - 200 concurrent users
* As we continue to increase number of concurrent users to 600, API is practically impossible to work. It takes more than 2 minutes per endpoint to get some response back. It is also possible that database will freeze or API's endpoints will not give any http response. It also depends on what time of the day requests are being triggered. During heavy network traffic, API will timeout or JMeter tests will fail or will receive no http response due to database lock.
